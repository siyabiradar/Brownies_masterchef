    Vegetable Oil – Just like a box mix brownie, we are going to use oil instead of butter.
    Sugar – I use regular white sugar in this recipe.
    Vanilla Extract – Be sure to use pure vanilla extract.
    Eggs
    Flour + Baking Powder
    Dark Chocolate Cocoa Powder – I recommend using dark chocolate cocoa powder. I use dark chocolate cocoa in most of my baking. In baking it makes a much more chocolatey final product. I’m sure they’d taste great with regular cocoa. But if you’re willing, give the dark a try.
    Salt – Adding a bit of salt to desserts brings out their sweetness.
